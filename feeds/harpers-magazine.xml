            <description><![CDATA[<p class="drop-cap">This summer marks a jolting return to socializing with friends, family, and seas of strangers. On the street, in museums, in restaurants, and in theaters, many people are faced with a painful contradiction: we want to be around one another more than ever, but months of isolation have made us hostile, exhausted, and even pained—probably more than most of us are willing to admit. Isolation affects the body in a similar way to stress, and in the wake of the pandemic, it’s difficult to distinguish between the two. Yet even before COVID-19, loneliness and stress were epidemic in societies that organized themselves out of interdependence in the name of efficiency and individuality.</p>
<p>In the July issue of <em>Harper’s Magazine, </em>the poet and essayist <a href="https://harpers.org/archive/2021/07/a-complicating-energy-notes-on-a-year-without-strangers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elisa Gabbert</a> writes about her own experiences during the pandemic (a “slow-motion crisis of the self”) and the scientific evidence that supports our need for all forms of human interaction<em>.</em> In this week’s episode of the podcast, Gabbert candidly speaks with <em>Harper’s </em>web editor Violet Lucca about her essay and our collective struggle to recover from the lockdown.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<div style="width: 200px; border: 1px solid black; background-color: white; margin-left: 30px; padding: 30px; padding-bottom: 30px; float: right; font-size: 90%;">A <a href="https://www.ledevoir.com/opinion/chroniques/615768/suivre-la-ligne" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">version</a> of this column originally ran in <em>Le Devoir</em> on July 5, 2021. Translated from the French by Elettra Pauletto.</div>
<p class="drop-cap">Over the past three years, <em>Harper’s Magazine</em> has developed a controversial reputation with regards to the #MeToo movement and woke culture, especially due to our publication of provocative articles by Katie Roiphe, John Hockenberry, and Thomas Chatterton Williams. After last summer’s publication of the so-called Harper’s Letter—a manifesto against ideological conformity—more and more readers have demanded (not always politely) a clear explanation of our editorial line. These demands often came with some bizarre implications. Are we allies of the neo-fascist right? Are we secretly Trumpists? Are we taking advantage of the white privilege that is so reviled by social-justice activists? Do we practice a “nice racism,” as Robin DiAngelo has titled her new book, which, according to the press release, maintains that “white progressives cause the most daily harm to people of color”?</p>
<p>My contributions to journalism and charity clearly don’t fit in with right-wing, racist, or sexist conspiracies. My record, which is mostly leftist, and my projects to defend the rights of the wrongfully convicted, especially those who are black, are all over the Internet, as are my writings, including four books. So far as I know, they do not contain any clandestine plans to ensure male or Caucasian domination of the earth. As for <em>Harper’s,</em> the matter is more complicated, given the lifespan of the magazine. It’s impossible to sum up in a few words a 171-year history. But it’s clear that a liberal (in the Anglo-Saxon sense), tolerant, democratic, and independent spirit has informed the sensibilities of the editorial staff since 1850. Our unofficial motto: beware of those who want to promote disingenuous opinions or the interests of those in power. I admit that in my 38 years as the publisher of <em>Harper’s</em>, my political commitments have had an influence on the magazine’s editorial content, but much less so than one might think. On the one hand, I’m beholden to history—for example, there’s no way one can turn what is fundamentally a literary magazine into leftist political propaganda. On the other hand, I get impatient reading too many points of view that are similar to my own. I often disagree with our writers, and I love surprise and irony in our pages. A perfect example: the brief article in the January 2019 issue by Michel Houellebecq called “Donald Trump Is a Good President,” which sparked a storm of negative, even violent comments on Twitter—as if <em>Harper’s</em> had suddenly switched sides and started to support an incompetent, corrupt president. It’s up to readers to decide for themselves, but just let me say that Houellebecq’s argument is far more nuanced and satirical than those of his attackers. And, of course, <em>Harper’s</em> has in no way become a pro-Trump publication.</p>
<p>That said, the truth is that <em>Harper’s</em> does have an editorial position. It’s not ideological, but it is solid, though I struggle to explain it and do so without much success. For my part, it is inspired by the writings of the great literary critic Lionel Trilling, particularly <em>Sincerity and Authenticity</em>, the collection of lectures he gave in 1970 at Harvard University. These lectures are where I look to find a possible resolution to the infernal dispute between traditional left-wing liberals and self-proclaimed leftist neo-radicals, and possibly quieting my critics.</p>
<p>Trilling was a literature professor at Columbia University until his death in 1975. He is worth reading in any era, but President Trump’s insincere and inauthentic tenure has made it essential. In his Harvard lectures, he discusses the works of Shakespeare, Rousseau, Molière, Diderot, and Freud, among others, in order to sum up the origins of and paradoxes in the words “sincerity” and “authenticity.” In Trilling’s view, these two words, which are essential to me, are not interchangeable, and the contemporary status of “sincerity” has greatly diminished: “If we speak it, we are likely to do so with either discomfort or irony. In its commonest employment it has sunk to the level of a mere intensive.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;” As such, Trilling laments the loss of sincerity’s significance, referencing Shakespeare’s <em>Hamlet,</em> a masterpiece of the battle between falsity and integrity, deception and honesty: “The extent to which <em>Hamlet</em> is suffused by the theme of sincerity is part of everyone’s understanding of the play.”</p>
<p>As Trilling suggests, “Authenticity” can step in where “sincerity” falls short. “Authenticity” might represent, he says, “a more strenuous moral experience than ‘sincerity’ does.” But they’re both part of my philosophy in equal measure.</p>
<p>At the risk of oversimplifying, my response to <em>Harper’s</em>’ harshest critics is to ask them to display the same level of sincerity and authenticity that we require of our staff and our writers. That is our editorial position. Are you critics up to the challenge?</p><p>The post <a href="https://harpers.org/2021/07/toe-the-line/" target="_blank">Toe the Line</a> first appeared on <a href="https://harpers.org/" target="_blank">Harper&#039;s Magazine</a>.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p class="drop-cap">Perhaps you’ve heard of Jon Meacham, a former editor in chief at <em>Newsweek </em>and author of many popular histories about the United States. His books are ubiquitous and regularly make bestseller lists. Yet the ideas in them are frequently reductive, incorrect, and strangely in thrall to a distinctly American version of the great man theory. Meacham is committed to fetishizing the role of the president and the men who have filled it, arguing that the office ennobles its occupants more than it corrupts them. Meanwhile, he conspicuously ignores the bottom-up social movements and profound economic tensions that historians have long recognized as crucial forces in American history.</p>
<p>That is how Thomas Frank sees it, anyway. In his combined <a href="https://harpers.org/archive/2021/07/jon-meacham-thomas-frank-soul-of-america/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review</a> of Meacham’s new book, <em>The Soul of America</em>, and the HBO documentary based on it, Frank skewers a centrist hero who has become expert at whetting the MSNBC crowd’s thirst for neoliberal platitudes. For Meacham, once a staunch Reaganite, the close alliance he enjoys with President Biden is only the latest evidence of a commitment to subordinating matters of policy to a nebulous politics of character and “soul.” This week, Frank explains to web editor Violet Lucca Meacham’s overly romantic approach to history and what it elides, his connections to President Biden, and how his popularity reflects a larger shift away from the projects that once defined American liberalism.</p>

            <pubDate>Thu, 08 Jul 2021 16:44:22 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p class="drop-cap">Michael Pollan’s new collection of journalism, <em>This is Your Mind on Plants</em>, recounts for the first time publicly the story of his decision to leave out key passages of his essay “<a href="https://harpers.org/archive/1997/04/opium-made-easy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Opium, Made Easy</a>,” which was published in the April 1997 issue of <em>Harper’s Magazine</em>. While I’m delighted that Pollan has reversed his self-censorship and restored the missing material—about making opium tea from his home-grown poppies and drinking the tea—I take issue with parts of his narrative, especially concerning my efforts, as publisher of <em>Harper’s,</em> to persuade him not to give in to fear that the Drug Enforcement Administration would raid his house and seize his property if we published the “recipe” for the tea as well as Pollan’s experience after consuming it. I refer readers to the author’s explanatory text in his new book, but I urge them to be skeptical about his version of what happened.</p>
<p>Pollan suggests that he was acting largely on the advice of our lawyer, Victor A. Kovner, who still represents <em>Harper’s Magazine</em>: that by cutting the riskier passages he would “minimize” his risk of prosecution under the absurdly harsh drugs laws of the era. While it’s true that Kovner did discuss various tactical and legal options with Michael, my recollection is that Victor was strongly and consistently in favor of publishing the piece in its entirety, which was certainly what the editor, Lewis Lapham, and I preferred and were urging Michael to do. Both Victor and I believed Michael’s fear of prosecution and arrest were greatly exaggerated, being confident that as a reporter he was protected by First Amendment guarantees. Describing the making and consumption of the opium tea was clearly an act of journalistic research, not a gratuitous attempt to get high with a controlled substance in a way that could be viewed, in Pollan’s words, as “taunting the government.” Victor and I also felt that the federal government would never risk hauling a writer for a major national magazine into court on such a flimsy charge and thus invite ridicule and criticism. To buttress his version of Kovner’s legal analysis, Pollan claims that Kovner cited <em>United States v. Progressive Inc.,</em> “a 1979 case in which the government had sought to stop <em>The Progressive</em> magazine from publishing an article containing instructions for making a hydrogen bomb, even though the instructions were based entirely on publicly available information.” This statement is disingenuous and incorrect. The two cases are not comparable: the government had sought and won an injunction against <em>The Progressive</em> to prevent publication of the piece, so that the Constitutional issue at stake was whether the government backed by a judge could impose “prior restraint” against a magazine as it did with the <em>New York Times</em> when the newspaper wanted to publish the Pentagon Papers. The government eventually dropped its case against <em>The Progressive</em>, and the article was published. With the Pollan article, there was never any question of pre-publication censorship by the government, only a concern about criminal prosecution. If we ever discussed the so-called H-bomb case, it was to reassure Michael that even reporting about something as sensitive and dangerous as nuclear weapons was protected by the First Amendment. No one would have argued—and no sane judge would have made the case—that building a hydrogen bomb and making opium tea were in any way equivalent.</p>
<p>Finally, there is the indemnification contract I signed on behalf of <em>Harper’s</em> that Pollan describes “as one of the most unusual contracts ever given to any writer by a publisher.” True, we promised to pay for just about everything bad that hypothetically might have befallen Michael and his family, including the value of his house and his legal defense. But I offered it with the goal of bucking him up so that we might publish the entire essay, uncensored. Evidently it had the opposite effect, since, as Pollan writes, “It was also frightening to read: <em>All the contingencies could actually happen</em>.” I didn’t think <em>any of the contingencies would actually happen</em>, and neither did Victor Kovner. We were just trying to calm a frightened writer.</p>
<p>Once he had the contract, Michael insisted on withdrawing the passages about making and drinking the tea. It was a bitter blow to me, because I have always put the freedom to publish in the forefront of my work, and I lost some respect for Pollan after that. His recent remarks on a radio podcast during which he laughingly speculates about my motives were simply not true: “My guess is he was hoping something would happen. He was hoping I would get arrested. This would put <em>Harper’s</em> on the map. This would be a giant case; he would take it in front of the Supreme Court, and he would. You know he has bottomless pockets.” But these nasty jibes also revealed a lack of seriousness and commitment about the very points he wanted to make in his <em>Harper’s </em>piece. “Opium Made Easy” was an excellent exegesis of the madness and hypocrisy of U.S. drug laws and the gratuitous viciousness of the government’s war against drug-users caught in the act of what are mostly victimless crimes. Since then, the statute of limitations has expired on Michael’s potential crime. But back then, Pollan took the easy way out. I don’t blame him for having been afraid. He just now shouldn’t try to lay responsibility for his decision on anyone but himself.</p><p>The post <a href="https://harpers.org/2021/07/regarding-michael-pollans-new-book-this-is-your-mind-on-plants/" target="_blank">Regarding Michael Pollan’s New Book This is Your Mind on Plants</a> first appeared on <a href="https://harpers.org/" target="_blank">Harper&#039;s Magazine</a>.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p class="drop-cap">Tales of the harrowing—and often degrading—working conditions at Amazon have spread far and wide. Yet the company has successfully circumvented attempts to change its ways. With the aid of extremely accommodating local, state, and national officials, America’s second-largest company (right after Walmart) has developed an elaborate system of workplace surveillance and anti-union propaganda to prevent its low-wage workers from organizing.</p>
<p>In the July issue of <em>Harper’s Magazine</em><em>,</em> <a href="https://harpers.org/archive/2021/07/hard-bargain-amazon-unionization-bessemer-alabama/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Daniel Brook</a> relates the concerns of workers in and around the Amazon fulfillment center in Bessemer, Alabama. The warehouse attracted national attention this spring when it played host to a fierce battle over unionization. Pro-union workers lost by a margin of more than two to one, but Brook shows that the internal deliberations were far more complicated than the results suggest. Both pro- and anti-union workers in the area also struggle with the legacy of Reconstruction, when racist and socioeconomic controls on working class people were codified into law. On this week’s episode of the podcast, Brook unpacks the lessons of his trips to Bessemer with <em>Harper’s</em> web editor Violet Lucca. In their conversation, Lucca and Brook speculate on what lies ahead for the Amazon precariat—and for the consumers who depend on their labor.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<div style="width: 200px; border: 1px solid black; background-color: white; margin-left: 30px; padding: 30px; padding-bottom: 30px; float: right; font-size: 90%;">A <a href="https://www.ledevoir.com/opinion/chroniques/608325/l-edition-du-samedi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">version</a> of this column originally ran in <em>Le Devoir</em> on June 7, 2021. Translated from the French by Elettra Pauletto.</div>
<p class="drop-cap">When I was a young reporter for a daily newspaper in Chicago, I soon learned that the Saturday edition could be used to “hide” articles that might risk attracting negative attention—even downright anger—from the top editors. They’d be too busy working on the Sunday edition—with its higher page count and circulation—to notice. So, if you wanted to pitch a dissident story and avoid editorial interference or offending the paper’s friends, the time to do so was toward the end of the day on a Friday afternoon.</p>
<p>That’s how I stumbled upon a buried treasure in the <em>New York Times</em>. It was published on May 15, a Saturday of course, and it talked about the long-term wage stagnation among the least educated people, those left out of the wealth boom of the techno-financial class that now dominates American society. At the bottom of the front page of the Business section was the headline, in the form of a question, “Is Washington at Fault for the Wage Gap?” The dominant thesis, often promoted by the <em>Times</em>, claims that the automation of labor has caused an inevitable, widening chasm between workers from the small top bracket of society and those from the large bottom bracket. But now, the <em>Times</em> was asking whether the authors of a new economic study were right to suggest that this gap actually was due to “intentional policy decisions.”</p>
<p>The study was conducted by the Economic Policy Institute (EPI), a think tank affiliated with the politically moderate left, and it is well worth a read. In fact, the authors of the study, Lawrence Mishel and Josh Bivens, are more candid than the <em>Times’</em> explanation of the study gives them credit for. “We refer in this analysis to wage <em>suppression</em><em> </em>rather than wage <em>stagnation</em><em> </em>because it was an actively sought outcome—engineered by policymakers who invited and enabled capital owners and business managers to assault the leverage and bargaining power of typical workers, with the inevitable result that those at the top claim a larger share of income.” The researchers state that between 1979 and 2017, pay for median workers lagged behind national productivity growth by 43 percent. In the 38 years analyzed in the study, the bottom 90 percent of workers suffered an anemic rise in salaries to the benefit of the top 10 percent, “mostly highly credentialed professionals and corporate managers.”</p>
<p>How did these clever policymakers in Congress—supported by hundreds of academic economists—achieve their ambitions? In many different ways: excessive austerity measures meant to increase unemployment and control inflation; the globalization of big business and of the work force, aimed at pitting American workers against cheap foreign labor; a brutal war on unions; the effective lowering of a minimum wage already eroded by inflation and weakening regulations, including on overtime; more numerous and more restrictive contracts; the deregulation of industry, the rise in mergers, and the outsourcing of production that led to an extraordinary concentration of power in purchasing and employment negotiations.</p>
<p>At times, the EPI’s analysis seems somewhat superficial—for example, when it references the effects of free trade on the labor market. However, it does take into account trade agreements such as NAFTA, which harm not just workers in the Rust Belt but also workers in occupations that aren’t directly affected by outsourcing: “While landscapers may not be displaced by imports, their wages suffer from having to compete with apparel (and auto, and steel) workers who have been displaced by imports.” Add to that number the eight million undocumented immigrants—the vast majority of whom work for lower wages than what is guaranteed by the law in all fifty states—and it’s easy to understand just how much workers suffer from an increasingly globalized market.</p>
<p>What is missing from this remarkable study is the “why.” As career economists, Mishel and Bivens rather naively explain how neoliberalism reached “great prominence, even in the Democratic Party,” as if they were unaware of the cynical transformation of the party into a corporate- friendly entity as far back as the 1970s. The “why” is that the neoliberal project promoted by the so-called New Democrats, and led by Bill Clinton, was conceived to fish in Republican waters and thus gather as much money as possible from Wall Street and big business in order to finance their electoral campaigns. The moral support they received from a neoliberal consensus in universities and in the mainstream media did not go unnoticed by the leadership of what had traditionally been known as the “party of labor.”</p>
<p>It’s clear that politicians from both the Republican and the Democratic sides have waged a four-decades-long war on the working and middle classes. What’s not so clear is why the <em>Times</em>, the quasi-official paper of the Democratic Party, would even report on this study. Why bother to mention it in a little-read Saturday edition after the war has more or less been won? Did the editors run it then on purpose? Or was it the work of a cunning journalist just taking advantage of a distracted boss one fine Friday evening?</p><p>The post <a href="https://harpers.org/2021/06/news-you-can-use/" target="_blank">News You Can Use</a> first appeared on <a href="https://harpers.org/" target="_blank">Harper&#039;s Magazine</a>.</p>]]></description>
