            <description><![CDATA[<p class="drop-cap">In Indianapolis, a 19-year-old killed eight people and wounded several others at a FedEx warehouse where employees were unable to call the police or family members because of a company policy forbidding workers from carrying cell phones.<sup><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/16/politics/mass-shootings-america-guns/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1</a> <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fedex-indianapolis-cell-phone-policy-employee-shooting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2</a></sup> A police department in Minnesota released body-cam footage of an officer killing an unarmed 20-year-old named Daunte Wright, some 10 miles away from the courthouse in which another officer, Derek Chauvin, is on trial for the death of George Floyd; the City of Chicago released a video recording of an officer killing 13-year-old Adam Toledo after he had lifted his hands in the air; Kenosha, Wisconsin, law enforcement announced that the officer who killed Jacob Blake would not face disciplinary action; and one of the police officers who shot Breonna Taylor in Louisville, Kentucky, was given a book deal.<sup><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_H710uztOQ3b6G-OvE_XWhlLQsMXypGHkrUW25JCzFU/edit?ts=607ee496#gid=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/15/us/adam-toledo-chicago-shooting-video.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4</a> <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/no-discipline-kenosha-police-officer-who-shot-jacob-blake-chief-n1263986" target="_blank" rel="noopener">5</a> <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2021/04/one-of-the-cops-who-killed-breonna-taylor-got-a-book-deal.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">6</a></sup> Federal health officials called for a temporarily halt to distribution of the Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccine after six people out of the more than 7 million who have received the shot fell ill.<sup><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/13/us/politics/johnson-johnson-vaccine-blood-clots-fda-cdc.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">7</a></sup> President Joe Biden announced that the United States will withdraw all troops from Afghanistan by September 11, and Republican members of Congress announced, and then subsequently canceled, plans for an America First caucus that would work to foster “common respect for uniquely Anglo-Saxon political traditions.”<sup><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/biden-us-troop-withdrawal-afghanistan/2021/04/13/918c3cae-9beb-11eb-8a83-3bc1fa69c2e8_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">8</a></sup> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/04/20/marjorie-taylor-greene-implosion-america-first-caucus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>The assistant defense minister of Australia reminded the nation’s armed forces that their chief mission remained the “application of lethal violence” after a controversial commissioning ceremony for the HMAS <em>Supply</em> that featured a dance troupe twerking in front of the 21,500-pound replenishment oiler.<sup><a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-04-14/military-reminded-lethal-violence-defend-australian-values/100066796" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10</a></sup> A Czech man turned over to authorities a T-34 tank and a SD-100 tank destroyer as part of a nationwide weapon-amnesty program, and a Yorkshire, England, woman whose partner was killed with a crossbow issued a call for British legislation regulating access to “medieval weapons.”<sup><a href="https://praguemorning.cz/czech-nationwide-weapon-amnesty-prompts-citizen-to-turn-tank-over-to-authorities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">11</a> </sup><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/apr/16/woman-who-lost-partner-in-crossbow-attack-wants-medieval-weapon-regulated" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>12</sup></a> The city council in Placerville, California—whose nickname, “Hangtown,” derives from a series of 19th-century lynchings—decided to remove the noose that had been featured on its seal, and Facebook apologized for removing the official page of the French town of Bitche after it was mistakenly flagged for containing offensive language.<sup><a href="https://localnews8.com/news/2021/04/14/city-known-as-hangtown-votes-to-remove-noose-from-its-logo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">13</a> <a href="https://www.cityofplacerville.org/placerville-city-history" target="_blank" rel="noopener">14</a> </sup><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/13/lifes-a-bitche-french-towns-facebook-page-shut-down-over-offensive-name" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>15</sup></a> “The name of our town seems to suffer from a bad interpretation,” said Bitche’s mayor.

<p>Japan announced plans to release into the Pacific Ocean more than 1 million tons of treated wastewater that was contaminated in the Fukushima nuclear disaster, prompting a spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry to urge Japan’s deputy prime minister to drink it himself.<sup><a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/04/japan-plans-release-fukushima-s-contaminated-water-ocean" target="_blank" rel="noopener">20</a> </sup><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/04/14/china-japan-fukushima-water-drink/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>21</sup></a> “The ocean is not Japan’s trash can,” said the spokesperson.

            <description><![CDATA[<p class="drop-cap">The photographer Richard Rothman spent more than a decade taking pictures in a small town along the Front Range of Colorado’s Rocky Mountains. The resulting monograph, <em>Town of C</em><em>,</em> was published by Stanley/Barker, and <a href="https://harpers.org/archive/2021/03/town-of-c-richard-rothman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a selection of the photographs</a> appears in the March issue of <em>Harper’s Magazine</em><em>.</em> The book’s scope is comprehensive, documenting the grandeur and the despoliation of the region’s geography and the lives and spaces of its poorest—and richest—residents. “Through portraits and landscapes,” the critic and curator Lyle Rexer writes in his introduction, “Rothman presents the paradox of expansiveness and confinement, of possibility and crushing limitation.”</p>
<p>In this episode of the podcast, Violet Lucca brings Richard Rothman and Lyle Rexer together for a conversation about Rothman’s new work and the current state of art photography. They discuss how the focus and narrative structure of <em>Town of C</em> changed over time, the role of art photography in a culture oversaturated with images, and the hundreds of minute decisions that go into composing a photograph.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p class="drop-cap">“S<em>ous les pavés, la plage</em>!” (“Beneath the pavement, the beach!”) was the rallying cry of the May 1968 protests in France. As demonstrators tore up paving stones in order to build barricades or to hurl at the police, they discovered that there was sand beneath the streets. Though this was a typical building practice, it reinforced the protesters’ belief that everyday life wasn’t quite what it appeared to be, but was rather an illusion manufactured by modernity, capitalism, and consumerism. During the early months of the pandemic, we were all confronted with the same truth. The levels of noise, garbage, and greenhouse-gas emissions pumped into the environment were drastically reduced because so many schools, workplaces, and restaurants were shuttered. Just as people abruptly changed where and how they spent their days, all sorts of wildlife began venturing into public places they’d previously avoided: deer roamed the streets of Paris while coyotes wandered around San Francisco. But these incursions weren’t really incursions at all: the natural world had been there all along. It became clear that animals, rather than living apart from human society, had always been living alongside us—our belief in absolute anthropocentric control was an illusion.</p>
<p>In “<a href="https://harpers.org/archive/2021/04/the-crow-whisperer-animal-communicators/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Crow Whisperer</a>,” which appeared in the April issue of <em>Harper’s Magazine, </em>Lauren Markham writes about the ways we might rethink our relationship with the environment. Following an incident involving some friends, their dog, and a murder of dive-bombing crows, Markham delves into the world of animal whisperers—specialists who serve as translators, negotiators, or arbiters between members of different species. In this episode of the podcast, <em>Harper’s </em>web editor Violet Lucca talks with Markham about the complexity of animal psychology, epigenetics, climate change, and a crow’s talent for nursing a grudge.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p class="drop-cap">This month will see the release of Blake Bailey’s <em>Philip Roth: The Biography</em>—the authorized biography of the famous novelist, who died in 2018. Roth himself selected Bailey to write his life story. In addition to many long conversations, Roth granted Bailey complete access to his personal archives and helped set up interviews with many of his friends, lovers, and colleagues.</p>
<p>In the March issue of <em>Harper’s Magazine,</em> the novelist and <em>Harper’s </em>contributing editor Joshua Cohen imagines how Bailey’s book might be received by Roth himself. From the comfort of his writing studio beyond the grave, Cohen’s Roth ruminates on the strange, perhaps self-destructive decision to commission his own biography, and proceeds to lament the result, which, he argues, downplays the literary production that made up most of his days (“MY BIOGRAPHER HAS NO INTEREST IN MY WRITING!!!!”) in favor of “interminable chapters and decades of reputation management, alternating with, if not relieved by, sexual transgressions.” Cohen’s ventriloquism of Roth is a gambit one has to think the author would have admired. As Cohen points out in this interview, Roth, too, had a penchant for throwing his voice.</p>
<p>In this episode of the podcast, Violet Lucca talks with Cohen about Philip Roth’s long career and his unclear legacy. Among other things, they discuss Roth’s late decree that “the book can’t compete with the screen”; his often unacknowledged influence on today’s American immigrant writers, as well as writers of autofiction; and an afterlife—or do we find ourselves there now?—in which everything will be as it is, just a little different.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p class="drop-cap">“Sometime in late 1991,” Don DeLillo told a <em>Paris Review</em> interviewer in 1993, “I started writing something new and didn’t know what it would be—a novel, a short story, a long story. It was simply a piece of writing, and it gave me more pleasure than any other writing I’ve done.” The result was the novella “Pafko at the Wall,” first published as a <a href="https://harpers.org/archive/1992/10/pafko-at-the-wall/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Folio</a> in the October 1992 issue of <em>Harper’s Magazine,</em> making up a third of the issue’s length. “Wherein the Giants clinch the pennant, Bruegel descends, a bomb explodes, Sinatra sulks, and a Harlem boy plays his own game,” read that month’s cover. A slightly revised version would later become the prologue to <em>Underworld,</em> a novel often described as DeLillo’s masterpiece.</p>
<p>The story takes place during the National League playoff game of October 3, 1951, when Bobby Thomson of the New York Giants hit a pennant-winning home run over the head of Brooklyn Dodgers left fielder Andy Pafko—an event known to baseball fans as the “Shot Heard ’Round the World.” Here, though, the famous game serves mostly as background, its action serving to repeatedly bounce the reader’s attention back into the stands. DeLillo, a writer who has always been fascinated by the mechanics of spectacle, wants us to watch the watchers—some of whom, such as Frank Sinatra, the radio announcer Russ Hodges, and FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, are spectacle makers (and manipulators) themselves. Hovering over the proceedings, meanwhile, are suggestions of darker energy: the secret knowledge, possessed by only the paranoid Hoover, that the Soviets have just performed a successful nuclear-weapons test, and racial tensions, briefly transcended by fandom, that are unloosed in the scramble over a suddenly famous ball.</p>
<p>In this episode of the podcast, we bring you excerpts of “Pafko at the Wall,” which was performed live at the 92nd Street Y by Billy Crudup, Zachary Levi, and Tony Shalhoub, interspersed with commentary by the novelist Jennifer Egan and the poet Rowan Ricardo Phillips. The full recording of the performance will be released on March 30 by Simon &amp; Schuster Audio. A video of the performance will be available for two days at <a href="https://92y.org/pafko"><u>92y.org/pafko</u></a> beginning on Sunday, March 28, in anticipation of the audiobook’s release.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p class="drop-cap">Twenty-one-year-old Robert Aaron Long was arrested after he shot and killed eight people in three Asian spas in and around Atlanta, in what was the deadliest mass shooting in the United States since August 4, 2019, when Connor Betts shot 26 people in 32 seconds in Dayton, Ohio.<sup><a href="https://apnews.com/article/georgia-massage-parlor-shootings-leave-8-dead-f3841a8e0215d3ab3d1f23d489b7af81" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1</a> <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/26-shot-32-seconds-details-videos-released-dayton/story?id=64953910" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2</a> </sup>Long, who had also planned to drive to Florida to attack “some kind of porn industry,” told authorities that the massage parlors were “a temptation for him that he wanted to eliminate.”<sup><a href="https://apnews.com/article/race-and-ethnicity-shootings-georgia-crime-sex-addiction-ad7becb7a9691a794dc78579c21e66e4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3</a></sup> Crabapple First Baptist, the church that Long had attended since childhood, deleted all of its social-media accounts, which included photos of Long attending services and a video of the sermon its senior pastor, Jerry Dockery, gave on the Sunday before the shootings, arguing that Christ’s return was imminent and that he would lead a war “against all who rejected his name.”<sup><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/religion/2021/03/17/atlanta-shooting-southern-baptist-pastors-wrestle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4</a></sup> “I don’t recall any sermons dealing specifically with racism, but the general tenor was to welcome and to be as inclusive as possible,” said Long’s former youth pastor. On Monday, it was reported that Mario González, husband of victim Delaina Yaun, had been handcuffed and detained but was not informed of his wife’s death for hours, and 21-year-old Ahmad Al Aliwi Alissa shot and killed 10 people in and around a supermarket in Boulder, Colorado, using an assault rifle 10 days after a judge blocked enforcement of a ban on such weapons.<sup><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/22/us/spa-shootings-officers-handcuffed-husband-of-victim-trndDelaina%20Yaun/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">5</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/03/23/us/boulder-colorado-shooting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">6</a> <a href="https://apnews.com/article/colorado-supermarket-shooting-10-dead-3da92f0d3db65afdb373cc6bb534a711" target="_blank" rel="noopener">7</a></sup> Four people were shot and killed over the weekend in Chicago, as were five-year-old Mya Patel, by a stray bullet inside a motel in Shreveport, Louisiana; 28-year-old Alessia Mesquita, by the father of her one-year-old baby, in New Haven, Connecticut; 39-year-old Michael Anansingh, while waiting for his sister outside a bar he frequented, in Brooklyn, New York; 40-year-old Christopher Ray Martinez, who was targeted because he was romantically interested in the same woman as his shooter, in Austin, Texas; and 45-year-old street vendor Lorenzo Pérez, by someone pretending to be a customer, in Fresno, California.<sup><a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/crime/2021/3/20/22341570/chicago-weekend-shootings-march-19-22-gun-violence-homicide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">8</a> <a href="https://www.fox8live.com/2021/03/22/shooting-hotel-leaves-mother-child-injured-suspect-arrested/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">9</a> <a href="https://www.newhavenindependent.org/index.php/archives/entry/woman_shot_dead_in_the_heights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10</a> <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/ny-brooklyn-shooting-victim-shot-outside-bar-20210323-rbd5mpvyxvdkxnirwmgrlxtbnm-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">11</a> <a href="https://eldiariony.com/2021/03/23/lluvia-de-balas-un-muerto-y-un-herido-por-tiroteos-en-peleas-callejeras-en-nueva-york/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">12</a> <a href="https://www.kxan.com/news/local/one-person-dies-in-southeast-austin-shooting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">13</a> <a href="https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/california-news/street-vendor-shot-killed-while-working-fresno/2556655/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">14</a></sup> “I don’t apologize for thoughts or prayers!” Ted Cruz shouted during a speech in the Senate opposing new restrictions on firearms.<sup><a href="https://www.rawstory.com/ted-cruz-2651181596/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">15</a></sup> “And the contempt of Democrats for prayers is an odd sociological thing!”</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p class="drop-cap">In 2002, a new crop of Dead Sea Scroll fragments that were said to have come from the Swiss vault of the late antiquities dealer Khalil Iskander Shahin went up for sale. These fragments were bought by a number of evangelical institutions, including the Museum of the Bible, which was founded by the family that owns the Hobby Lobby chain of arts-and-crafts stores. In the March issue of <em>Harper’s Magazine,</em> <a href="https://harpers.org/archive/2021/03/false-prophets-forged-dead-sea-scrolls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Madeleine Schwartz</a> describes the odd provenance of the fragments and evaluates whether they could be forgeries.</p>
<p>In this episode, Schwartz and <em>Harper’s</em> web editor Violet Lucca discuss the tendency for self-delusion in the antiquities market, as well as the slow process by which counterfeit goods can be distinguished from genuine artifacts. They also consider the complex issue of ownership, given the colonial violence that has historically allowed Western countries to acquire relics. “[Knowing where objects came from] is hugely important for the ethical implications,” Schwartz says. “It’s also really important for the financial implications, because, in general, no one wants to think that what they own is either fake or going to lead them to having to deal with a lawsuit.”</p>
