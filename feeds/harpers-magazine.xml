            <description><![CDATA[<div style="width: 200px; border: 1px solid black; background-color: white; margin-left: 30px; padding: 30px; padding-bottom: 30px; float: right; font-size: 90%;">A <a href="https://www.ledevoir.com/opinion/chroniques/608325/l-edition-du-samedi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">version</a> of this column originally ran in <em>Le Devoir</em> on June 7, 2021. Translated from the French by Elettra Pauletto.</div>
<p class="drop-cap">When I was a young reporter for a daily newspaper in Chicago, I soon learned that the Saturday edition could be used to “hide” articles that might risk attracting negative attention—even downright anger—from the top editors. They’d be too busy working on the Sunday edition—with its higher page count and circulation—to notice. So, if you wanted to pitch a dissident story and avoid editorial interference or offending the paper’s friends, the time to do so was toward the end of the day on a Friday afternoon.</p>
<p>That’s how I stumbled upon a buried treasure in the <em>New York Times</em>. It was published on May 15, a Saturday of course, and it talked about the long-term wage stagnation among the least educated people, those left out of the wealth boom of the techno-financial class that now dominates American society. At the bottom of the front page of the Business section was the headline, in the form of a question, “Is Washington at Fault for the Wage Gap?” The dominant thesis, often promoted by the <em>Times</em>, claims that the automation of labor has caused an inevitable, widening chasm between workers from the small top bracket of society and those from the large bottom bracket. But now, the <em>Times</em> was asking whether the authors of a new economic study were right to suggest that this gap actually was due to “intentional policy decisions.”</p>
<p>The study was conducted by the Economic Policy Institute (EPI), a think tank affiliated with the politically moderate left, and it is well worth a read. In fact, the authors of the study, Lawrence Mishel and Josh Bivens, are more candid than the <em>Times’</em> explanation of the study gives them credit for. “We refer in this analysis to wage <em>suppression</em><em> </em>rather than wage <em>stagnation</em><em> </em>because it was an actively sought outcome—engineered by policymakers who invited and enabled capital owners and business managers to assault the leverage and bargaining power of typical workers, with the inevitable result that those at the top claim a larger share of income.” The researchers state that between 1979 and 2017, pay for median workers lagged behind national productivity growth by 43 percent. In the 38 years analyzed in the study, the bottom 90 percent of workers suffered an anemic rise in salaries to the benefit of the top 10 percent, “mostly highly credentialed professionals and corporate managers.”</p>
<p>How did these clever policymakers in Congress—supported by hundreds of academic economists—achieve their ambitions? In many different ways: excessive austerity measures meant to increase unemployment and control inflation; the globalization of big business and of the work force, aimed at pitting American workers against cheap foreign labor; a brutal war on unions; the effective lowering of a minimum wage already eroded by inflation and weakening regulations, including on overtime; more numerous and more restrictive contracts; the deregulation of industry, the rise in mergers, and the outsourcing of production that led to an extraordinary concentration of power in purchasing and employment negotiations.</p>
<p>At times, the EPI’s analysis seems somewhat superficial—for example, when it references the effects of free trade on the labor market. However, it does take into account trade agreements such as NAFTA, which harm not just workers in the Rust Belt but also workers in occupations that aren’t directly affected by outsourcing: “While landscapers may not be displaced by imports, their wages suffer from having to compete with apparel (and auto, and steel) workers who have been displaced by imports.” Add to that number the eight million undocumented immigrants—the vast majority of whom work for lower wages than what is guaranteed by the law in all fifty states—and it’s easy to understand just how much workers suffer from an increasingly globalized market.</p>
<p>What is missing from this remarkable study is the “why.” As career economists, Mishel and Bivens rather naively explain how neoliberalism reached “great prominence, even in the Democratic Party,” as if they were unaware of the cynical transformation of the party into a corporate- friendly entity as far back as the 1970s. The “why” is that the neoliberal project promoted by the so-called New Democrats, and led by Bill Clinton, was conceived to fish in Republican waters and thus gather as much money as possible from Wall Street and big business in order to finance their electoral campaigns. The moral support they received from a neoliberal consensus in universities and in the mainstream media did not go unnoticed by the leadership of what had traditionally been known as the “party of labor.”</p>
<p>It’s clear that politicians from both the Republican and the Democratic sides have waged a four-decades-long war on the working and middle classes. What’s not so clear is why the <em>Times</em>, the quasi-official paper of the Democratic Party, would even report on this study. Why bother to mention it in a little-read Saturday edition after the war has more or less been won? Did the editors run it then on purpose? Or was it the work of a cunning journalist just taking advantage of a distracted boss one fine Friday evening?</p><p>The post <a href="https://harpers.org/2021/06/news-you-can-use/" target="_blank">News You Can Use</a> first appeared on <a href="https://harpers.org/" target="_blank">Harper&#039;s Magazine</a>.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p class="drop-cap">What if we conceived of the fight against climate change as a “just war”—as both the biggest fight in human history and a global search for meaning? As fires rage, oceans rise, and pandemics ravage, the demands for international solidarity and world-scale deployments of resources are readily apparent. But in the face of ideological divisions wrought by centuries of capitalist and colonial destruction, it’s not always easy to envision what solidarity really is, or what it needs to be.</p>
<p>In “<a href="https://harpers.org/archive/2021/06/prayer-for-a-just-war-finding-meaning-in-the-climate-fight/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prayer for a Just War</a>,” published in the June issue of <em>Harper’s Magazine</em>, Greg Jackson urges us to see the “first comprehensive global challenge” as an opportunity to define our global character by our collective grit, humility, and trust. In addition to outlining the many counterattacks we must mount on political and technological fronts, Jackson imbues the mythic concept of the “existential threat” with historical and spiritual meaning. In this episode, Jackson delves into those ideas with web editor Violet Lucca, then gestures toward ways we might help each other step out of the deadly (and dull) alienation we all seem to share.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p class="drop-cap">For those who make, or might once have made, a living as artists, the pandemic and the economic depression that followed it took away two vital sources of revenue: in-person events and day jobs that sustained creative endeavors. Yet, as <a href="https://harpers.org/archive/2021/06/stages-of-grief-what-the-pandemic-has-done-to-the-arts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">William Deresiewicz</a> describes in the June issue of <em>Harper’s Magazine,</em> all sectors of the arts economy were already vulnerable for collapse: years of declining public arts funding and education, as well as the rise of “free content,” had fundamentally destabilized the ability for expression.</p>
<p>The ways in which COVID-19 sharpened and highlighted existing social failures harkens back to another global health crisis: the AIDS epidemic. Writer, activist, and historian Sarah Schulman’s newest book, <em>Let the Record Show: A Political History of ACT UP New York, 1987-1993</em><em>,</em> tells the story of activists who waged some of the most effective political campaigns of the century to force politicians, the populace, and drug companies into acknowledging and addressing AIDS. An <a href="https://harpers.org/archive/2021/06/blood-ties-sarah-schulman-let-the-record-show/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">excerpt</a> of <em>Let the Record Show </em>also appears in the June issue.</p>
<p>In this episode of the podcast, web editor Violet Lucca moderates a conversation between Sarah Schulman and William Deresiewicz, author of <em>The Death of the Artist,</em> exploring links between the two crises. Among other topics, they discuss the aesthetic and societal costs of confining art making to the margins of the workday, the new challenges of organizing against Big Tech, and the value of artists to social movements.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p class="drop-cap">According to Hollywood legend, director Mervyn LeRoy “discovered” Lana Turner when she was sixteen, at the soda counter of Schwab’s Pharmacy in Los Angeles. While the tale is apocryphal, the notion that anyone could be a star motivated untold hordes of youths to go west for decades afterward. (Let’s be honest: most of them turned out like the “grotesques” of Nathanael West’s <em>The Day of the Locust.</em>) So is it so surprising that, according to a 2019 poll, 54 percent of Americans between the ages of thirteen and thirty-eight say they would become social-media influencers if given the chance? For the June issue of <em>Harper’s Magazine,</em> <a href="https://harpers.org/archive/2021/06/tiktok-house-collab-house-the-anxiety-of-influencers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Barrett Swanson</a> spent five days at a TikTok collab house: a plush Los Angeles mansion, funded by two Silicon Valley investors, where a group of conventionally beautiful, college-aged influencers lived rent-free, tasked only with posting videos of themselves for their millions of followers. Yet, as sultry as this sounds, Swanson found that these young men struggled with anxiety, depression, and an inability to think critically about the forces driving them to generate content. The pressure to please, gain followers, and get good ratings is creeping into all of our lives, regardless of industry. (Even doctors get star ratings now.) In this episode, Swanson joins <em>Harper’s </em>web editor Violet Lucca to discuss the alternately surreal and sad reality of life inside of the collab house; the pressures of the “passion economy”; algorithms; and the critical thinking and digital literacy that everyone—not just the young—are sorely lacking.</p>
